#Â Make memes great again

This is just a script to caption what could be Trump new laws.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomas-maurice/promulgator/master/static/sample.jpg)]

Simply invoke it with the stupidest idea you can find (the good one would not work and
probably break the script)

```
./promulgate.sh "Deprecate RSA in favor of good ol' fashioned base64"
```

And the script will generate an image at `out.jpg`

The generated images are dank and ugly af on purpose.

Have fun.

PS: Oh, that's basically a 4 liner using `imagemagick`.
